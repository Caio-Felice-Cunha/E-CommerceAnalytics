## Business Problem
> [Data source](https://github.com/Caio-Felice-Cunha/E-CommerceAnalytics/tree/main/datasets): Data is fictitious and was generated by Data Science Academy staff


An international electronic commerce (E-commerce) company that sells electronic products wants to discover important information from its customer database.<br>

The products are stored in a warehouse at the company's headquarters. After completing the purchase on the company's website, the customer receives the product at home, anywhere in the world. Products are shipped by Ship, Airplane or Truck, depending on the delivery region.<br>

With each purchase, the customer can receive a discount depending on the weight of the product purchased. Each customer can make calls to the company's support in case of doubts or problems and after receiving the product the customer can leave a review about the shopping experience. The only personal data about the customer that is available is the gender.<br>

By exploring the data, we must understand how they are organized, detect any problems and analyze the data from different perspectives.

## Business Assumptions
It is assumed that the company wants to better understand the data to provide better products, as well as avoid delays and save on costs.

## Solution Strategy
To solve the problem we use the Python language
* Step 01: Separation of Categorical and Numerical Variables;
* Step 02: Exploring Numerical / Categorical Variables;
* Step 03: Univariate Analysis - Box Plots / Dist Plots / Violin Plots / Count Plot (Categorical);
* Step 04: Bivariate Analysis - Correlation Map / Pair Plot;
* Step 05: Categorical Columns x Target Variable;
* Step 06: Using the data to answer buiness problems.

## Data Insights
For companies that produce and/or sell products, there is often a concentration and investment of both resources and energy in trying to figure out how to improve what is being sold.
However, often there is not as much effort and investment in trying to find out if there is a better way to get the product to the buyer. <br>
In the present case, we see high rates of delay, which can greatly harm the company, which despite having an excellent product, ends up not delivering it to the consumer in the expected time.

## Business Results
With the adjustment in the delivery date, most likely consumer satisfaction will increase and the number of new customers will also increase, as well as the consolidation of regular customers.

## Conclusions
It was concluded that there are several products with delay issues.<br>
In several areas (shipping mode, product priority, among others) products are experiencing a delay of 50% or more. <br>
Therefore, it is necessary to better understand the transport market in order to hire better companies that meet the deadline for delivering products.

## Next Steps
* Accepting suggestions :D
